**Staff Engineer | Beckman Coluter Urinalysis** [July 2023 â€“ July 2024]

The Beckman Coulter Urinalysis devices are widely utilized in clinical laboratories for automated urinalysis. These devices play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency and reliability of urine analysis, thereby aiding in the diagnosis and monitoring of renal and urinary tract conditions.

As a Staff Engineer, I had the privilege of designing the next-generation software for the Beckman Coulter Urine Analysis Device. I collaborated with multidisciplinary teams, including hardware, firmware, algorithm experts, system architects, and software architects, to ensure the design was accurate, user-friendly, and met all customer requirements.

**Role**
  - Architecture:
    
    Significantly contributed to the finalization of the software architecture by collaborating with multiple stakeholders, evaluating diverse technologies and conducting comprehensive proofs of concepts.
    - Collaborated with stakeholders to convert high-level requirements into Epics and Features.
    - Estimated features and built the backlog for the team, facilitating smooth and efficient development cycles.
    - Collaborated with the Scrum Master to create technically feasible and demonstrable vertical slicing of features, ensuring streamlined and efficient feature delivery.
    - Worked with the system architect to formulate the test strategy for the product.
    - Collaborated with external UI/UX designers to finalize the workflow and assisted in creating screens using WinUI.
    - Collaborated with external team in South Korea to design interfaces for third-party instrument firmware.
    - Trained team members on different modules and architectures, enhancing their understanding and efficiency.    
  - Frontend:
    - Created PoC using multiple front end technologies to finalize user interface.
    - Conducted usability testing to refine the user interface and enhance the overall user experience.
  - Backend:
    - Investigated legacy architecture and created a proof of concept (PoC) to refactor tightly coupled code into a microservices architecture.
    - Identified and addressed key bottlenecks like integration with modern technologies, unit testing etc within the legacy codebase.
    - Exposed the backend C++ microservices using gRPC technology, which ensured a smooth and faster integration into modern user interface technologies.
    - Replaced legacy named pipes with RabbitMQ to support the decoupling of software modules, enhancing the scalability and flexibility of the system architecture.
    - Created a proof of concept (PoC) to demonstrate the testing approach, ensuring comprehensive coverage and validation of the system's backend API.
  - Embedded
    - Programmed and optimized embedded systems using C#, facilitating seamless communication between the device's hardware components and software.
    - Reused existing embedded development frameworks to integrate new hardware instruments into the software, enhancing the device's capabilities and performance.
    - Integrated the embedded machines with hardware successfully.
