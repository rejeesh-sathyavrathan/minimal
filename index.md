 - Trained team on WinUI
 - Created low level design for the front end following MVVM pattern

**Role**
  - Architecture:
    - Collaborated with stakeholders to convert high-level requirements into Epics and Features.
    - Estimated features and built the backlog for the team, facilitating smooth and efficient development cycles.
    - Collaborated with the Scrum Master to create technically feasible and demonstrable vertical slicing of features, ensuring streamlined and efficient feature delivery.
    - Worked with the system architect to formulate the test strategy for the product.    - 
    - Collaborated with external UI/UX designers to finalize the workflow and assisted in creating screens using WinUI.
    - Collaborated with external team in South Korea to design interfaces for third-party instrument firmware.

  - Backend:
    - Investigated legacy architecture and created a proof of concept (PoC) to refactor tightly coupled code into a microservices architecture.
    - Identified and addressed key bottlenecks like integration with modern technologies, unit testing etc within the legacy codebase.
    - Exposed the backend C++ microservices using gRPC technology, which ensured a smooth and faster integration into modern user interface technologies.
    - Replaced legacy named pipes with RabbitMQ to support the decoupling of software modules, enhancing the scalability and flexibility of the system architecture.
    - Created a proof of concept (PoC) to demonstrate the testing approach, ensuring comprehensive coverage and validation of the system's backend API.
  - Embedded
    - Programmed and optimized embedded systems using C#, facilitating seamless communication between the device's hardware components and software.
    - Reused existing embedded development frameworks to integrate new hardware instruments into the software, enhancing the device's capabilities and performance.
